        <h1>Poverty Trap</h1>
        <div class="date">2025</div>

        <p>Poverty is widespread in Africa; people have been trying to fight it since the 1940s.</p>

        <p>Poorer countries have found themselves in a poverty trap for many years, and Africa has often been cited as an example.</p>

        <p>Take the case of fuel prices. When the prices of fuel go up, it affects the economies and deepens levels of poverty.</p>

        <p>Fuel prices can go up because of wars and conflicts, high global demand, currency fluctuations, changes in taxes and subsidies, or even natural disasters.</p>

        <p>When it happens, the rich countries get a hit, but the poor countries get a knockout.</p>

        <p>The major raw material for manufacturing fertilizer is fossil fuel, and most poorer countries depend on agriculture to feed themselves and to earn income.</p>

        <p>When fertilizer prices go up, farmers in poor countries reduce the size of their farms to cut costs.</p>

        <p>Farmers then reduce the number of workers, and those who remain may face wage cuts or lose their jobs.</p>

        <p>The consequences quickly spread to the family. The farm workers' kids will not have enough food, which will affect their concentration at school.</p>

        <p>The farm workers will be forced to save their energy by not doing much.</p>

        <p>Biologically, humans need a minimum of 1,200 kcal/day to survive and not die.</p>

        <p>Then we need an extra ~800–1,800 kcal to work productively. When nutrition falls short, both survival and productivity are at risk.</p>

        <p>The farm worker's bright daughter is forced to drop out of school and start working because the family needs food now more than education.</p>

        <p>The farm worker gets depressed; the only hope he had was his daughter to get them out of poverty.</p>

        <p>This is how generation after generation gets into a poverty trap according to Economist Esther Duflo.</p>
