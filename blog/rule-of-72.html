        <h1>Rule of 72</h1>
        <div class="date">2025</div>

        <p>"I have no money"</p>

        <p>If you grew up in an African family, you are familiar with this line.</p>

        <p>I remember one day at home, my brother accidentally found money after my mum said those words. He took it. When asked, he simply replied: "But you said you didn't have money....so which money did I take?"</p>

        <p>Growing up, I did not have any sense of saving or investing because "I have no money" shaped the way I related to money. How? Spending until I get to "I have no money."</p>

        <p>I did not know we had simple rules that could help save and invest.</p>

        <p>Recently I learnt about the rule of 72....it's never too late. It's a simple mathematical hack that shows how long it takes to double your investment.</p>

        <p>For example, if you have a milk shop that returns 7% yearly, the 72 rule says you can calculate the return to know how many years it will take to double your investment: 72 (rule) ÷ 7% return ≈ 10 years. That means at 7% return, it will take about 10 years to double the investment. If the return is 10%, then 72 ÷ 10 ≈ 7, so it would take around 7 years.</p>

        <p>It doesn't matter how much you put as the initial investment, for example:</p>

        <p>→ If you invest Ksh. 1,000 at 7% annual return → it becomes about Ksh. 1,967 (almost 2,000) in ~10 years.</p>

        <p>→ If you invest Ksh. 10,000 at the same 10% annual return → it also becomes about Ksh. 19,487 (almost 20,000) in ~7 years.</p>

        <p>This rule helps determine which business to invest in.</p>

        <p>On that note, one of the best "saving and investments" I am making now is helping people move money affordably.</p>

        <p>I help people in Europe send money to Africa instantly with zero fees through <a href="https://lemfi.com" target="_blank">LemFi</a>.</p>

        <p>💡 New users even get €15 free when sending €100+ with code "SAM": <a href="https://lnkd.in/dEExKRqd" target="_blank">https://lnkd.in/dEExKRqd</a></p>

        <p>(P.S. My brother got away with it that day...and I guess my mum found new hiding spots whenever she said "I have no money")</p>
